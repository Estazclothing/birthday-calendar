# Problem Statement

John, a very good friend of mine is having his birthday today but I didn't know because he didn't tell me. How can I have a system that will remind me of a friend's birthday? That's what Birthday Calendar is for.

# How Will It Work?

1. A user registers and enters the birthday.
2. A user can create any group and all members of that group will get notified of every birthday in the group.
3. A user can share his birthday details with another user and get notified.
